#PCB Assembly and soldering
## Preparation
For assemblying PCB you will need:

- 3 x 2-Pin screw terminals 5mm Pitch (DC5, DC12, HEAT)
- 9 pins single row male 2.54mm pitch header strip (PMS, DS1)
- 4 pins single row male 2.54mm pitch header strip (I2C)
- 3 pins single row male 2.54mm pitch header strip (DHT)
- 2.54mm pitch SPDT slide switch OR 3 pin single row male 2.54mm pitch header strip + 2.54mm jumper (HEAT DC SW)
- 4.7kΩ resistor (R1)
- 47kΩ resistor (R2)
- 1kΩ resistor (R3)
- FET transistor TO220 THT (HEAT RELAY)
- 2 x 8 hole single row female 2.54mm header strip (Wemos)

## Soldering order
1. Solder all resistors and cut redundant wires
2. Solder Wemos female headers
3. Solder all male headers
4. Solder screw terminals
5. Solder FET transistor and cut redundant wires
